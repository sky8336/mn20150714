COMPILATION
===========

To compile, as root use make in the working directory of the code:

  # make

TESTING
=======

To load the module, do (as root):

  # insmod hello.ko

You can check for an entry for the module (if it is loaded) from the output of:

  # lsmod | grep hello

To remove the module, do (as root):

  # rmmod hello

By default, debug is set to 'n' (no) in the Makefile. Do another compilation with debug set to 'y' and you will see the debug messages printed in the kernel log.

Kernel log messages can be viewed from the output of dmesg.

To cleanup the compiled modules, use:

  # make clean
