COMPILATION
===========

To compile the driver, as root use make in the working directory of the code:

  # make

Compile the application using:

  # gcc test.c -o test

TESTING
=======

To load the module, do (as root):

  # insmod char-read.ko 

You can check for an entry for the module (if it is loaded) from the output of:

  # lsmod | grep char

Create a device file using:

  # mknod /dev/hello c 250 0

Provide executable permissions to test, and run the application to test it:

  # ./test

To remove the module, do (as root):

  # rmmod char-read

Kernel log messages can be viewed from the output of dmesg.

To cleanup the compiled modules, use:

  # make clean
